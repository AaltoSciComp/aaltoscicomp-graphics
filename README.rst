Logo
----

Logos created using Inkscape - use that to edit.  The logo fonts are
Nimbus Sans, not how to make sure it is editable across other systems.

``logo-dev``: master file we are using to iterate.  Note that it has
*many* layers, turn them off and on to experiment.

More files will be added later once we have a decision on what to use.

* ``logo-hexagons-01``: original credit to Enrico Glerean @eglerean
* ``logo-hexagons-02``: change to Nimbus Sans font and other improvements, credit to Seppo Äyräväinen @sayravai
* ``-compact`` versions have font outlines instead of fonts.


Size notes
----------
Notes: if hexagon side is a, diameter is 2a, then height of the
3-hexagon logo is 3.5a, width is 2a*sqrt(3), and radius ofthe circle
it fits in is 4a.


Stickers
--------
Hex sticker spec: https://github.com/terinjokes/StickersStandard

Our main stickers are:

* ``stickers/sticker-hexagons-02-plan.svg``
* ``stickers/sticker-hexagons-02-nameurl.svg``

The hexagonal stickers should be printed 4.399 cm wide.  The height
(of full hexagon) would be 5.080 cm.



Patches

First order was 6cm tall.  Sample filename for reordering:
``284-38424.jpg``.
